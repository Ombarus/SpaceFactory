# (Untitled) Space Factory Game


## Introduction

**(Untitled) Space Factory Game** is a Prototype Space Factory game. The goal is to take inspiration from Dyson Sphere Program and Satisfactory and give it a unique twist (somehow). The main game loop is still very much under intense development. Potential design idea include having the player concentrate more on creating beautiful space stations while automating resource collection and production.
